Here are two scripts made by Beno√Æt Legat
in order to help you sort the vocabulary
you know and the one you don't know
at the same time you are learning it.
All of this automatically.

If you want to use it, please COPY
(don't move it, copy/pase it) the
entire script_trainer directory out
of Dropbox and then use it :)

This scripts are written in bash so
Windows users will have to launch an
emulator while other users (GNU/Linux,
Mac OS, BSD, Solaris, Unix, ...)
will just have to run it from the
command line.

To run a script named 'main.sh' just
write (without the '$')
$ ./main.sh
If it says that you don't have the
permission, write
$ chmod u+x main.sh
And then retry
$ ./main.sh

To get help on how to use the script
write
$ ./main.sh -h

trainer.sh:
	This is the main script, more info with
	$ ./trainer.sh -h
merge.sh:
	If there is 2 files where you store
	Vocabulary and you want to merge it.
	This script is your friend. Again
	$ ./merge.sh
table:
	This is an example of vocabulary list that
	can be used.
